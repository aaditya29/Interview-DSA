# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! 🚀

This repository is dedicated to learning, practicing, and understanding various **Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA) problems** along with their patterns, theoretical background, and applications. It includes problems from multiple sources like **LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and other educational platforms**.

## Repository Overview

- **Data Structures:** Implementation and explanation of fundamental data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Tries, HashMaps, etc.
- **Algorithmic Patterns:** Categorized problems based on common problem-solving techniques like Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Divide and Conquer, Backtracking, etc.
- **LeetCode Questions:** Collection of LeetCode problems along with solutions and explanations.
- **Other Resources:** Questions from different competitive programming and academic sources.
- **Theory & Background:** Notes and theoretical explanations to build a strong foundation in DSA.
